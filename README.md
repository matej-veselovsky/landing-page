# Yoranish Dictionary

## Introduction
This website is created as a part of The Odin Project's Foundation course. Since I hate creating "empty" templates, I decided to use this opportunity to create website as a dictionary of yoranish language.

## What is yoranish?
Yoranish is a constructed language (conlang) created by **Luk치코 Tom치코ek** - a friend of mine. He keeps all the vocabulary - _over 30 000 words!_ - in an app in his phone. In my previous studies of Python and SQL I already created a simple app that converted his csv into machine-readable format and using Heroku I put it on the web. This is my first time seriously learning front-end development, so that website looks _terrible_.

## Why is it called _landing-page_?
Landing page is a name of The Odin Project project, intending the learner to fully use flexbox property of CSS. I created this repo in the beginning of the exercise. After I am happy with how the website looks I intend to fork it and use it as a real thing.
